Write an if statement that asks for the user's name via input() function. If the name is "Bond" make it print "Welcome on board 007." Otherwise make it print "Good morning NAME". (Replace Name with user's name)

Do the same thing as exercise 7-a this time making sure if the name is bond with lower case b it still prints "Welcome on board 007."
